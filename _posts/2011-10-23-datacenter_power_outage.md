<p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> This morning, we experienced a power outage at our datacenter provider Hetzner. While we are waiting for more detailed information, we already made sure that all our services restarted cleanly. All production servers are back up and running.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;12:35:</strong>&nbsp;Hetzner <a href="http://hetzner-status.de/en.html#137">announced</a>&nbsp;power issues in two of their data centers that caused servers to reboot. Due to network issues, some systems, although online, may not be able to respond fast enough to all incoming requests.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;13:23:</strong> Hetzner &nbsp;established that the UPS systems in the two impacted data centers had switched off. They're still investigating the cause.</p>
<p><em>As soon as we have further information, we will post them here.</em></p>
