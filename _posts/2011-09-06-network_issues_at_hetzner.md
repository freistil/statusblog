<p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> Network connections to our servers hosted in the german Hetzner datacenter in Falkenstein are slow or unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSE:</strong> Excavation works severed a fibre optics line in east Germany that carries the main traffic to the Hetzner datacenter in Falkenstein. (See also the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html#98">Hetzner status page</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fiber%20Seeking%20Backhoe&amp;defid=5694118">Fibre Seeking Backhoe</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 21:18h:</strong> The cable carrier notified Hetzner that the fibre optics cable had been severely damaged. Repairs will take a few more hours.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSED 23:30h:</strong> The fibre connection is back up.</p>
