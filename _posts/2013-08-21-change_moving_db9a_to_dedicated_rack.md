#### ISSUE:

To reduce the impact of network issues on our database infrastructure, we are going to move the MySQL node db9a.drupalconcept.net to a server rack exclusively used by us.

We will execute this change on Tuesday 2013-08-26 between 19:00 and 21:00 UTC (21:00 - 23:00 CEST).

We do not expect any downtime since we will switch to the spare node in advance of this maintenance.

We will post updates on the change on our status blog.

#### CAUSE:

Infrastructure change to improve resilience against network issues.

#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-08-21 08:30 UTC â€“ Announcement created.
