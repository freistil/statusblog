#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem in one of the datacenters we use that impacts the operation of many servers. 

Update 2013-02-07: We're again experiencing connectivity issues with servers running in Hetzer datacenter 10. This time, there's an [official status update](http://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html#1258). According to the post, a router firmware bug caused the outage.

While diagnosing a support request about file access errors, we found that the connectivity problems may have caused a split-brain situation within the nodes of one of our storage clusters. We've taken measures to correct the inconsistent data set.


#### CAUSE:

Network problems in Hetzner datacenter 10.


#### TIMELINE:

* [2013-02-06 10:20 UTC] Incident opened.
* [2013-02-06 10:35 UTC] Shutdown of affected storage cluster node stor02a.
* [2013-02-06 10:50 UTC] Network issues seem to be gone.
* [2013-02-06 12:10 UTC] Added stor02a back to the storage cluster.
* [2013-02-06 12:20 UTC] Incident closed. 
* [2013-02-07 09:40 UTC] Incident reopened. We are experiencing network problems in this datacenter again.
* [2013-02-07 10:56 UTC] Connectivity is stable again.
* [2013-02-07 15:03 UTC] Support request leads us to a split-brain situation in one of our storage clusters.
* [2013-02-07 17:37 UTC] After doing fresh backups of both storage cluster nodes, we initiated the self-heal process for the affected directory and were able to start file replication again.
* [2013-02-07 21:28 UTC] We've scheduled a self-heal run for the whole storage volume for 00:00 CET.
* [2013-02-08 00:45 UTC] Self-heal finished successfully.
* [2013-02-08 16:55 UTC] Since we got no further support inquiries, we consider this incident closed and will follow up with problem management ("How can we prevent such an incident in the future?".
