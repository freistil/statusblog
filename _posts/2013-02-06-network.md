#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem in one of the datacenters we use that impacts the operation of many servers. 

Update 2013-02-07: We're again experiencing connectivity issues with servers running in Hetzer datacenter 10. This time, there's an [official status update](http://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html#1258). According to the post, a router firmware bug caused the outage.

While diagnosing a support request about file access errors, we found that the connectivity problems may have caused a split-brain situation within the nodes of one of our storage clusters. We're currently checking this.


#### CAUSE:

Network problems in Hetzner datacenter 10.
