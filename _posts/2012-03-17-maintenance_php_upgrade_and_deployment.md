**ISSUE:** From Thursday, 2012–03–22 23:00, to Friday, 2012–03–23 05:00 CET, we will do a platform-wide upgrade to PHP 5.3 and roll out an improved deployment process.

Please see [DrupalCONCEPT: PHP upgrade and deployment improvements](http://www.freistil.it/2012/03/drupalconcept-php-upgrade-and-deployment-improvements/) in our company blog for further details.

**CONCLUSION:** All PHP upgrades were executed successfully. We needed to postpone the deployment upgrade, though, and will catch up on it shortly.
