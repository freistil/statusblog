#### ISSUE

On Friday 2013-05-10 between 22:00 and 04:00 UTC, we are going to perform software upgrades on many of our systems. These upgrades will include a new MySQL server version which requires a restart of the database service.

Since the expected downtime of a few seconds does not warrant a manual failover in most cases, we will only switch our central database servers but not the local databases on DrupalCONCEPT POWER and PRO plans.

#### CAUSE

Security updates to several services.
