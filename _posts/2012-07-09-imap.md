#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem on our mailcluster `mail.topcluster.net` that causes IMAP logins to fail.


#### CAUSE:

Configuration error. With a planned configuration change, another change that had been stuck in our system management for a long time got triggered. This accidental change was not compatible with our current infrastructure any more and blocked access to the IMAP user database. By reverting this change, normal operation could be restored.

We apologize to all affected customers for the interruption.


#### TIMELINE:

* [16:02 CET] Incident opened. 
* [16:37 CET] Incident closed.
