#### ISSUE:

Our datacenter provider Hetzner is going to upgrade their network infrastructure. This maintenance will improve our servers' network bandwidth. While newer routers will simply need a configuration update, older routers will have to be replaced.

On 2013-09-09, in the time between 21:00 UTC (23:00 CEST) and 03:00 UTC (05:00 CEST) the next day, router replacements will affect the following servers and clusters:

freistilbox clusters:

* repo1 (Git repository)
* c52
* c54
* c61

DrupalCONCEPT PRO clusters:

* pro29
* pro38
* pro31
* pro39

Single servers:

* web9
* m18
* power10
* power11
* power14
* power17

On clusters consisting of more than one node, web applications will stay available on the other nodes not affected by the change. Single servers (e.g. DrupalCONCEPT POWER) and single-box freistilbox clusters will suffer a short downtime, probably in the range of 10-15 minutes.


#### CAUSE:

Planned network maintenance.


#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-09-05 -- Incident opened.
* 2013-09-10 -- Incident closed.
