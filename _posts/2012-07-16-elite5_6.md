#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem that impacts the operation of our DrupalCONCEPT ELITE clusters elite5 and elite6.


#### CAUSE:

A high number of database update operations used up much of the of the database cluster's disk I/O capabilities which resulted in slower query handling.


#### CONSEQUENCES:

We will not add any more databases to this cluster and use eventual opportunities to migrate existing databases to a new cluster with higher performance.


#### TIMELINE:

* [17:48 CET] Incident opened.
* [18:30 CET] We're experiencing unusual high database write load, which in turn causes longer page request processing times. We're analysing the source of this increased write load.
* [19:00 CET] The high load has subsided. Incident closed.
