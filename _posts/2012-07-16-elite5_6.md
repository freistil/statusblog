#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem that impacts the operation of our DrupalCONCEPT ELITE clusters elite5 and elite6. 


#### CAUSE:

Not yet determined.


#### TIMELINE:

* [17:45 CET] Incident opened. 
* [18:30 CET] We're experiencing unusual high database write load, which in turn causes longer page request processing times. We're analysing the source of this increased write load.

*We are analyzing the issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
