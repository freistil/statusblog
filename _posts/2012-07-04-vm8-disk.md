#### ISSUE:

We've experienced a double disk failure on VM host vm8. This impacts the following servers:

* power12.drupalconcept.net
* power13.drupalconcept.net
* power15.drupalconcept.net
* power16.drupalconcept.net
* m17.topcluster.net


#### CAUSE:

Disk failure.


#### TIMELINE:

* [21:20 CET] Incident opened. 
* [23:43 CET] The disk has been replaced.
* [00:15 CET] The system and its VMs are running with decreased performance due to the RAID rebuild.
* [00:30 CET] Rebuild is progressing ok and will probably be finished in the morning.
* [00:42 CET] We are noticing errors also on the primary disk. Starting emergency backups.
* [02:30 CET] The file systems seem to be irreparable. We'll rebuild the servers from their backups.

*We will add more details here as soon as possible.*
