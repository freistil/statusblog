#### ISSUE:

To reduce the impact of network issues on our database infrastructure, we are going to move the MySQL node db8a.drupalconcept.net to a server rack exclusively used by us. 

We will execute this change on Tuesday 2013-07-09 between 19:00 and 21:00 UTC (21:00 - 23:00 CEST).

We do not expect any downtime since we will switch to the spare node in advance of this maintenance.

These are the DrupalCONCEPT clusters affected by this change:

* elite5 (all sites)
* elite6 (some sites)
* pro20
* pro34
* pro35

We will inform all customers affected by this change directly and post updates on our status blog.

#### CAUSE:

Infrastructure change to improve resilience against network issues.

#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-07-05 15:30 UTC â€“ Announcement created.

*We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
