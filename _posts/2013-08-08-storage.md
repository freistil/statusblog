#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem with one of our storage nodes that impacts the operation of several application clusters.


#### CAUSE:

One the storage node had a disk failure. The automatic recovery to a spare disk is putting additional I/O load on the system which impacts overall performance.


#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-08-08 07:11 UTC: Incident opened.
* 2013-08-08 07:20 UTC: We decided to declare the storage node as failed and removed it from the cluster so it can recover as quickly as possible. Operation continues on the other node.
* 2013-08-08 16:18 UTC: RAID resync to spare disk finished successfully.
* 2013-08-08 22:31 UTC: Failed disk has been replaced and will become new spare disk.
* 2013-08-09 08:10 UTC: Incident resolved.
