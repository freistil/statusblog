title: Security incident at Hetzner AG
category: DrupalCONCEPT
status: resolved

<p>On Thursday, October 6th, Hetzner AG (in whose datacenters many of our servers are running) announced that "<span><a href="http://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html#126">Possible data abuse requires you change your access data.</a>"</span></p>
<p><span>This potential abuse does only affect Hetzner administrative systems,&nbsp;especially the Hetzner Robot customer interface. </span></p>
<p>Since our servers are completely independent from Hetzner's administrative systems, none of them are affected by this incident.&nbsp;We also took care of securing our own customer data stored at Hetzner.</p>
<p>In summary, this security incident does not impact any services we are providing to our customers.</p>
