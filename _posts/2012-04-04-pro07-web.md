**ISSUE:** 

File access on the cluster nodes of DrupalCONCEPT cluster pro07 are very slow at the moment. Because website asset files get delivered only slowly, the webserver is highly under load.

We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.

**CAUSE:** The cluster filesystem has trouble synchronizing the two cluster nodes. 

**TIMELINE:**

* 23:05 We will let the synchronization resume over night. Tomorrow, we're going to continue fixing sync conflicts.
* 19:17 Synchronization is still going on, but with low impact on website operation. We are fixing synchronization errors manually where they occur.
* 18:14 Nodes are still synchronizing at maximum I/O. In the worst case, this needs a few hours to finish.
* 17:40 Trying to resynchronize the cluster nodes.
* 17:09 Reopened incident report
* 15:29 Closed incident report
* 15:19 Opened incident report
