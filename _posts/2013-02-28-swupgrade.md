#### ISSUE

On Monday 2013-03-04 between 22:00 and 04:00 UTC [updated since, see below], we are going to perform software upgrades on many of our systems. These upgrades will include a new MySQL server version which requires a restart of the database service.

Since the expected downtime of a few seconds does not warrant a manual failover in most cases, we will only switch our central database servers but not the local databases on DrupalCONCEPT POWER and PRO plans.

**Rescheduled:** Shortly before the planned maintenance window, we received new updates for MySQL. Because we needed time to test these first, we decided to postpone the upgrade by 24 hours. So the upgrade will now take place on Tuesday 2013-03-05, 22:00 to Wednesday, 2013-03-06 04:00 UTC.


#### CAUSE

Security updates to several services.


#### TIMELINE:
