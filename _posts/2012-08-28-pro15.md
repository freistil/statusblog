#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem that impacts the operation of server/cluster pro15. 


#### CAUSE:

Log file contents suggest a hangup in the cluster filesystem that connects both cluster nodes. We'll schedule a software upgrade.


#### TIMELINE:

* [11:26 CET] Incident opened.
* [11:28 CET] Hanging processes on main node make failover to standby node necessary.
* [11:31 CET] Failover to standby node is incomplete because database user accounts are missing. The cause is a bug in our legacy deployment mechanism ("DC1"). We rolled out an emergency fix.
* [11:41 CET] Failover to standby node complete.
* [11:45 CET] Main node doesn't react to requests for automatic reset.
* [11:53 CET] Sent request for manual reset to datacenter team.
* [12:10 CET] Sent additional support request to investigate automatic reset problem.
* [12:29 CET] Phone contact with datacenter team.
* [12:39 CET] Main node is online again.
* [12:43 CET] Switchover back to main node successful.
* [12:45 CET] Incident closed.
