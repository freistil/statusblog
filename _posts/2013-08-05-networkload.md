#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a network problem at the Hetzner data center that impacts the operation of several DrupalCONCEPT and freistilbox servers and clusters.


#### CAUSE:

Hetzner found the network issues are caused by a DoS attack: http://www.hetzner-status.de/de.html#1915.


#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-08-05 12:21 UTC -- Incident opened.
* 2013-08-05 13:10 UTC -- Hetzner initiates black hole routing for UDP traffic to the affected subnet to reduce network load.

*We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
