#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem that impacts the operation of our DrupalCONCEPT ELITE clusters elite5 and elite6. 


#### CAUSE:

High memory usage on be5a lead to swapping memory. This used up much of the of the database and file storage cluster's disk I/O capabilities which resulted in slower query handling and file delivery.


#### TIMELINE:

* [06:45 CET] Incident opened. 
* [06:47 CET] Failover to standby server.
* [06:50 CET] All sites are operational again. We are currently optimizing memory usage to minimize the necessity to use swap space.

*We are analyzing the issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
