#### ISSUE:

*Maintenance announcement:*

On Thursday, 2012-05-15, 23:00 to 05:00 CET, we are going to do Apache and MySQL component upgrades as well as a Linux kernel upgrade to apply security fixes on **all** PRO-S, PRO, POWER, ELITE and managed servers. 

We don't expect any downtimes for websites hosted on PRO-S, PRO and ELITE clusters.  
For POWER and managed servers there will be downtimes of about 5 to 15 minutes since the server has to be rebooted.

* [2012-11-15 23:05 CET] Upgrades started.
