From this Saturday (2012-12-22) on, our team will be off recharging.

During the holiday time, we’ll only do **emergency support**. That means we’ll only handle outages and other incidents that impact the delivery of existing websites.

We’ll resume working on tasks that aren’t connected to such incidents on Monday, January 7th 2013.

So, if you plan to launch a new website over the holidays or need other kinds of assistance, please [let us know immediately](https://freistil.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new)!
