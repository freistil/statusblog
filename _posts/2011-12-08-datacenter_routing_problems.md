<p><strong>ISSUE</strong>: This morning our datacenter provider in Germany had major routing issues, the uplink to DE-CIX was impaired. Because of this all traffic had to be rerouted, which led to temporary reachability failures.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7:37</strong>: All server are reachable again and all services are up and running.</p>
