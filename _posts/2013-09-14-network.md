#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing network issues that impact the operation of multiple clusters. A high rate of packet loss in Hetzner data center #16 slows down network communication and blocks web server resources.


#### CAUSE:

A network attack that impacted our connectivity.

* 2013-09-14 16:32 UTC: Data center on-call detected and blocked a DoS attack affecting one of the network segments in which we have servers.
* 2013-09-14 17:56 UTC: Out monitoring again detects high packet loss from and to servers in DC #16. Incident reopened.

*We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
