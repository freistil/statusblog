<p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> Since 18:08 CEST, we're experiencing massive network problems that affect the operation of our web hosting platforms and components hosted in the datacenters of our provider Hetzner AG. According to their <a href="http://www.hetzner-status.de/">status page</a>, they're suffering a DDOS attack.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The DDOS attack had been quite substantial with traffic rates of up to 20Gbps. Hetzner claims they have it under control now.&nbsp;</p>
