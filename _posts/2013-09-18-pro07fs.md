#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem with the shared storage of the DrupalCONCEPT cluster pro07.


#### ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION:

Our research found that the most probable cause of the problem is a bug in the cluster filesystem software.

Since we won't be able to fix this bug within a short enough time, we decided to switch to local filesystem operation. This restores full website operation but at the cost of making the active cluster node a single point of failure. (It's basically just a managed server now, much like our DrupalCONCEPT POWER servers.)

We're transferring all files to another storage cluster now and as soon as both sides are in sync, we'll attach pro07 to this storage, restoring redundant file storage.


#### TIMELINE:

* 2013-09-18 08:12 UTC: Incident opened.
* 2013-09-18 09:54 UTC: Decision to restore operation by switching to local filesystem operation.

*We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
