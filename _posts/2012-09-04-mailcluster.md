#### ISSUE:

For an update of the cluster filesystem software, we need to take our mailcluster mail.topcluster.net offline for about 1h. The maintenance will take place today, 2012-09-04, from 19:00 UTC to about 20:00 UTC.


#### CAUSE:

Software upgrade is necessary for performance and security reasons.


#### TIMELINE:

* [09:34 UTC] Incident opened. 
* [20:09 UTC] The software upgrade was finished successfully. Now the cluster filesystem will upgrade its metadata over night. We don't expect this to impact the operation of our email services.

*We will add more details here as soon as possible.*
