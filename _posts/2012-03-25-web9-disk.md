**ISSUE:** Due to disk problems, the managed server web9.topcluster.net is operating with limited functionality.

**CAUSE:** Filesystem errors cause the OS kernel to put the root fs into read-only mode.

**TIMELINE:**

* 25.03.2012 18:14 UTC -- On-call sysop notices that the system now repeatedly switched its root fs to read-only because of fs errors. The fs probably needs to be rebuilt. Emergency backups running.
