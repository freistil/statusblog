#### ISSUE:

Our datacenter partner Hetzner advised us that they are going to do extensive maintenance work on their routing infrastructure across all datacenters.

Work is planned for the following dates:

* 2013-02-28, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC (we apologize for the short notice)
* 2013-03-05, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC
* 2013-03-07, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC

Hetzner expects a downtime of maximum 15 minutes during these maintenance windows.

Should a central component of our infrastructure be affected, we will take the appropriate measures (e.g. switching to a standby system).


#### CAUSE:

Maintenance work.


#### TIMELINE:

* [2013-02-27 21:46 UTC] Incident/Announcement opened. 

*We will add more details here as soon as possible.*
