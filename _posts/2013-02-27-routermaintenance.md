#### ISSUE:

Our datacenter partner Hetzner advised us that they are going to do extensive maintenance work on their routing infrastructure across all datacenters.

Work is planned for the following dates:

* 2013-02-28, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC (we apologize for the short notice)
* 2013-03-05, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC
* 2013-03-07, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC

Hetzner expects a downtime of maximum 15 minutes during these maintenance windows.

Should a central component of our infrastructure be affected, we will take the appropriate measures (e.g. switching to a standby system).


#### CAUSE:

Maintenance work.


#### TIMELINE:

* [2013-02-27 21:46 UTC] Incident/Announcement opened. 
* [2013-02-28 04:03 UTC] Our main monitoring system at Hetzner shows most systems unreachable, which was to be expected. External monitoring shows actual impact on multiple websites, though.
* [2013-02-28 04:15 UTC] Most websites are online again. Only Hetzner datacenter #12 is still down.
* [2013-02-28 04:33 UTC] All websites are back up again.
* [2013-03-05 04:03 UTC] Our main monitoring shows multiple hosts unreachable. Again, multiple websites are affected.
* [2013-03-05 04:15 UTC] All websites are back up again.
* [2013-03-07 04:05 UTC] Multiple hosts are unreachable. Multiple websites are affected.
*We will add more details here as soon as possible.*
