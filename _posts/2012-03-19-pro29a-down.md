**ISSUE:** Websites on cluster PRO29 are down. 

**CAUSE:** Due to a harddisk failure on the standby server, it had to be shut down for maintenance. This caused unexpected locking problems in the cluster filesystem on the active server. To release those locks, we had to reboot the active server.

**TIMELINE:**

* 10:20: All services are up again.
