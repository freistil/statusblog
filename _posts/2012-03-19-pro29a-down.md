**ISSUE:** The cluster PRO29 is down. We are taken measures to restore the service.

**CAUSE:** Due to a harddisk failure on the host system, the standby host had to turned off. This caused an unexpected error in the cluster filesystem that could be fixed by restarting.

**TIMELINE:** 10.20 CET: All services are up again.
