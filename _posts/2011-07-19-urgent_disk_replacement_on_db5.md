title: Urgent disk replacement on db5
status: closed
category: DrupalCONCEPT

<p><strong>ISSUE:</strong> We have a failed disk on the active node of database cluster db5.drupalconcept.net. The RAID system ensures that everything keeps working. The disk will be replaced today between 21:00 and 22:00 CEST.&nbsp;Since we're going switch over to the standby node before having the disk replaced, the operation of websites depending on db5 will not be affected.</p>
<p><strong>RESOLVED:</strong> The disk has been replaced and the RAID array is working normally again.</p>
