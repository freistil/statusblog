<p><strong>ISSUE:</strong>&nbsp;Database replication between DrupalCONCEPT PRO/shared cluster nodes pro07a and pro07b needs to be rebuilt again. To rebuild replication, we have to do a complete data export with all tables locked for consistency. This will impair the operation of all websites on the cluster during the data export (estimated downtime: &nbsp;1h). We will start the rebuild process today at 23:30h.</p>
<p><strong>resolved:</strong>&nbsp;Replication is in sync again.</p>
