#### ISSUE:

We are experiencing a problem that impacts the operation of server repo1.freistilbox.net. This affects freistilbox git repositories.


#### CAUSE:

The host the repository server runs on is not booting anymore after a reset.

A misconfiguration in the boot manager prevented the host from booting.  
Correcting this the host is working fine, all repositories are reachable again.

#### TIMELINE:

* [2013-03-16 21:07 UTC] Incident opened. 
* [2013-03-16 21:30 UTC] Still unreachable. Setting up new host.
* [2013-03-16 23:52 UTC] repo1 is back up and all repositories are reachable again.

*We are working on this issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
