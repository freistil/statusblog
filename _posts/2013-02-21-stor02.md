#### ISSUE:

In our storage cluster stor02, one of the two nodes crashed and had to be rebooted. Boxes connected to stor02 experienced a short freeze until they disconnected from the defective node due to access timeout.

The node came online after the reboot. We expect all operation to normalize during the next minutes.


#### CAUSE:

Not yet determined.


#### TIMELINE:

* [2013-02-21 10:19 UTC] Incident opened. 
* [2013-02-21 10:24 UTC] The failed node is back online.

*We are analyzing the issue and will add more details here as soon as possible.*
